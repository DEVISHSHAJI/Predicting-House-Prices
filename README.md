# Predicting-House-Prices
Project Title: Predicting House Prices
Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on various features. You'll explore the dataset, perform data preprocessing, train a predictive model, and evaluate its performance.

Dataset:
You can use the Boston Housing dataset, which is available in the scikit-learn library. You can load it as follows:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
import pandas as pd

# Load the Boston Housing dataset
boston = load_boston()

# Create a DataFrame for easy manipulation
data = pd.DataFrame(boston.data, columns=boston.feature_names)
data['target'] = boston.target
Project Steps:
Data Exploration:

Understand the structure of the dataset.
Check for missing values.
Explore the distribution of the target variable (house prices) and features.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values if any.
Check for outliers and decide whether to remove or transform them.
Explore feature engineering possibilities.
Data Visualization:

Create visualizations to better understand the relationships between different features and the target variable.
Feature Selection:

Use statistical methods or machine learning techniques to select the most relevant features.
Model Building:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Choose a regression algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, random forest) and train the model.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared).
Visualize the predicted vs. actual house prices.
Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional):

If you used a model with hyperparameters, perform tuning to optimize the model's performance.
Documentation:

Document your code with comments and a README file explaining the project, dataset, and steps taken.
Tools and Libraries:
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
Jupyter Notebook for code development and documentation
GitHub Repository:
Create a GitHub repository and organize your code and documentation. Make sure to include the dataset, Jupyter Notebook or Python script, and a README file explaining the project.

Remember to commit your changes regularly and write meaningful commit messages. This project provides a good foundation for learning and practicing various aspects of data science, from data exploration to model evaluation. Feel free to customize and expand upon it based on your interests and skill level.
